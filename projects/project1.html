    <h1> Statement of Work Redlining </h1>

    <h3> Problem </h3>

    <p> When a company looking to hire a service (buyer) and staffing company (supplier) are drafting a statement of work (SOW) they make suggests changes to clauses. These buyer can view the suggested changes, but there is no way to implement them.  </p>

    <h3> Research </h3>

    <p> Speaking with the implementation team provided valuable insight into the process of redlining SOW clauses and the issues that clients face.</p>


    <p> In order to implement the suggested chages, the buyer company would have to have one tab open to view the suggested changes (pictured above) while simultaneously having a tab open where they could make edits (pictured below).  </p>


    <p class="quote"> "The MSP/Client claim that this is not helpful (to only view changes) and causes them to have separate tabs open in order to fully review the clause before completing their edits." </p>

    <h3> Proposed Workflow </h3>

    <p> I created a flow chart to illustrate the current workflow and the proposed workflow. </p>

    <h3> Ideation </h3>

    <p> To eliminate this workaround, I brainstormed ideas to eliminate the workaround. The proposed change was to provide the client a way to accept or reject a change immediately after they view the suggestion. </p>

    <p> Based on this idea, I created various mockups to demonstrate different ways to accept or reject changes along with an image depicting the proposed workflow. </p>

    <h3> Stay Tuned! </h3>

    <p> I am currently working on this project and will be presenting these ideas to the client soon to get their feedback. </p>
