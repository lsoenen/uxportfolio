      <h1 class="project-title"> SAP Fieldglass Talent Network </h1>
      <p class="subtitle"> Designing flows for react-responsive website application <p>

      <h3> Background </h3>

      <p> Fieldglass Talent Network is a responsive website set to release November 2021. It was created to accomodate for the growing gig worker economy and allows companies to search within a new portal for independent contractors or freelancers.  </p>

      <h3> My Role </h3>

      <p> Design a flow where workers will be able to view all of their assignments (jobs). </p>

      <h3> Requirements </h3>

      <p>
        • Workers need to be able to view their assignments
        <br>
        • Workers need to be able to access their assignments from the home page of the application.
        <br>
        • Workers should be able to exit FTN and enter the Fieldglass.net to view details related to their assignments
        <br>
        • Mobile and desktop designs should adhere to Fiori design guidelines
      </p>

      <h3> Research </h3>

      <p> With limited time and resources I was not able to speak to actual users for this project. However, I did as much research as I could online to learn more about the nature of freelance work and here is what I found...</p>

      <ul class=research>
        <li> With the rise of digital platforms freelance work is becoming more popular </li>
        <li> Gig workers often have more flexible schedules and in some cases can set their own hours or work from home </li>
        <li> It is estimated that gig worker's size, which covers independent or non-conventional workers, is 20% to 30% of the economically active population in the United States and Europe. </li>
      </ul>


      <p> However I still had some questions before starting the design </p>

      <p> Questions:</p>
        <ul class=research>
          <li> What happens when an assignment is completed? (Most of these projects are short term…)</li>
          <li> Is it important for workers to view their completed assignments or only assignments that are currently happening? </li>
          <li> Why may a worker need to reference assignment details after they have completed the assignment? </li>
          <li> What details about their assignments are most important for them to view? (Budget, spend, etc). </li>
        </ul>
