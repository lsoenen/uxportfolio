    <h1> Fieldglass Talent Network </h1>

    <h3> Background </h3>

    <p> Fieldglass Talent Network is a responsive website set to release November 2021. It was created to accomodate for the growing gig worker economy and allows companies to search for independent contractors or freelancers that perform short-term work.  </p>

    <h3> My Role </h3>

    <p> Work alongside a senior designer to help build mobile and desktop screens for different flows throughout the application. </p>


    <h3> Reset Password Flow </h3>

    <p> The first flow that I worked on was the reset password flow. Here are a few screenshots for both the mobile and desktop views. </p>
