      <h3> Lessons Learned </h3>

      <ol class="lessons-learned">
        <li> Be creative when it comes to gathering data </li>
          <ul class="lesson-learned">
            <li>
              Access to users and resources might not always be available so be scrappy when it comes to interviews and data
            </li>
            <li>
              Even as little as five users answering interview questions can provide invaluable insight.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <li> Never assume what the problem is </li>
          <ul class="lesson-learned">
            <li>
              It is easy to assume what the issue is. However, talking to users and observing how they interact with the product can often lead to discovering where the real issues lie.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <li> Propose big ideas and then scale them back if necessary </li>
          <ul class="lesson-learned">
            <li>
              Ideas that you have are worth proposing even if you know they will be out of scope. Often it can lead to other ideas that are within scope.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <li>  Be patient when your ideas cannot be implemented, and persevere by inventing multiple alternatives.
            <ul class="lesson-learned">
              <li>
                it's important to remember that even great ideas sometimes can't get implemented when yoou have an install base as large as SAP's, which brings with it a long list of customer backlog requests."

      <h3> Background </h3>

      <p>  SAP Fieldglass helps staffing companies submit workers to job postings. When submitting candidates, they can either "Submit New" candidates or "Submit Existing" candidates. </p>

      <p>  In the system each worker has their own unique workforce record. This record is what gets submitted when a staffing company chooses to "Submit Existing." If the staffing company chooses to "Submit New" they are creating a new workforce record in the system. </p>

      <h3> Problem </h3>

      <p>  A large number of staffing companies were choosing to "Submit New" workforce records when those candidates already had records in the system. This lead to many duplicates being entered and for some reason suppliers were not using the "Submit Existing" option. This created downstream issues when looking for candidate workforce records. </p>

      <h3> Research </h3>


      <p> To begin the process, I needed a better understanding of how submitting a job seeker to a job posting works. To do this I created user scenarios and mapped out the flow. This helped me understand why a supplier arrives at the page and also the different steps that can be taken once they are there. </p>

      <!-- <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/scenarios.png"/> -->

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/flow-chart.png"/>


      <h4 class="bestpractice"> Asking the Right Questions </h4>

      <p> With a clear understanding of the submission process, I still did not know why suppliers were not using the "Submit Existing" button. To me, the two options and their purpose seemed very clear, but I am not the user. So to try and put myself into their shoes, I started formulating a list of questions that would help provide insight and identify the underlying issue.   </p>

      <p> One strategy I find helpful when it comes to formulating good questions and putting together a story is the <a href="https://comm.gatech.edu/resources/writers/5ws" target="blank"> Five W's Method. </a> </p>

      <h4> Initial Questions: </h4>

      <ul class="project-two">
        <li> What is the total number of duplicate workforce records entered into the system? </li>
        <li> What percent of all job seeker submissions used "Submit Existing?" </li>
        <li> What percent of suppliers understand the difference between "Submit New" and "Submit Existing?" </li>
      </ul>

      <p> For a list of all my questions: <a href="../Images/submitx/one-pager.docx"> Download One Pager </a>


      <h4 class="bestpractice"> Data Driven Decision Making </h4>

      <p> To find answers to these questions, I reached out to the Data Mining Team (DBM). Here is what we found: </p>

      <h4> 1. "What percent of all job seeker submissions used "Submit Existing?" </h4>



      <!-- <ul class="data">
        <li> Total Submit Existing Submissions (2015-2019)</li>
          <ul class="data">
            <li> United States = 4,488,000 </li>
            <li> European Union = 184,253 </li>
          </ul>
        <li> Total Submit New Submissions (2015-2019) </li>
          <ul class="data">
            <li> United States = 15,717,968 </li>
            <li> European Union = 759,551 </li>
          </ul>
      </ul> -->

      <!-- <p> Using these numbers I could calculate the percentage of all submissions that used "Submit Existing." </p> -->

      <p class="percentages"> 22.01%  (US) &nbsp &nbsp 19.52%  (EU)  </p>

      <p>   </p>
      <p> </p>


      <h4> 2. "What is the total number of duplicate workforce records that are created?" </h4>

      <p class="percentages">  4,214,435 (US)  &nbsp &nbsp  201,545 (EU)    </p>

      <br>

      <h4> 1. "How many suppliers understand the difference between the meaning of "Submit New" and "Submit Existing" actions? </h4>

      <p> This question was not one that the DBM team could answer, so I reached out to the Professional Services (PS) team.  </p>

      <p class="psquote"> "Most suppliers are actually clear in their understanding of both actions, but it's faster to submit all candidates using 'Submit New' because the 'Submit Existing' search is too difficult." -Sreymoun (Professional Services) </p>

      <p> According to Sreymoun, most suppliers did understand the difference between the actions, but they just find searching for existing candidates (pictured below) too difficult. In many cases, she said it was just faster to submit all candidates as new candidates.  </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/search.png">

      <h4 class="bestpractice"> Customer Journey </h3>

      <p> The answers to the initial questions allowed me to better understand the pain points customers experience when submitting candidates to a job posting. To communicate the findings to the rest of the team I created a journey map. This helped everyone better understand the frustrations and align on what problem we needed to solve. On top of this, we could also identify areas of opportunity that would allow us to improve the experience even more. </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/customer-journey-submit-job-seeker-final.png">



      <h4 class="bestpractice"> Improving Search </h4>

      <p> After hearing from real suppliers that searching for existing workers was too difficult, I wanted to figure out how it could be improved. To do this I created more research questions focused on the search process itself. I used UserZoom to conduct user interviews hear what real suppliers had to say. I was eager to know...what is it about searching for candidates that makes it so difficult?  </p>

      <br>

      <h4> Finding 1 - Skills & qualifications </h4>

      <p> I wondered what they search when trying to find candidates and what information they want to see about those candidates.  </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/what-do-you-search.png">

      <p> Based on these results, it was clear that suppliers wanted to see not only see the name of the candidate, but also their skills. This made sense because skills and qualifications of a candidate are important when submitting them to a job posting. However, in the current search results table (below), the skills were not shown. </p>

      <p> An idea I had to improve this would be to automatically display the candidates in the database whose qualifications best match those detailed in the job posting. This could eliminate the need to search altogether and speed up the process even more. (This idea was out of scope as it was too big of a dev effort, but worth noting for future releases.)   </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/search.png">

      <br>
      <br>

      <h4> Finding 2 - Potential Matches </h4>

      <p> Another finding that helped us uncover an issue was the answer to our magic wand question. "If you could change any one thing regarding your entire process of submitting job seekers to job postings, what would it be? (i.e. if you had a magic wand, what's the one change/addition/removal you’d like to see supported by SAP Fieldglass?)"  </p>

      <p class="psquote"> "We frequently get a warning after entering a new candidate that a match already exists. However, there is no way to tell why that happens and there is no 'view matching candidates...' " </p>

      <p> This feedback points to the functionality that occurs when submitting a new candidate. If the system detects that the candidate may already exist, it gives a warning. </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/potentialmatch1.png">


      <br>
      <br>

      <p> However, this warning modal only identifies matches, but does not allow for further action. This lead me to think that the number of duplicate submissions could be greatly reduced if there was a way to submit the potential match instead. I wondered if this was just a bug and shared the information with my manager.  </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/potentialmatch2.png">


      <h3> Ideation </h3>

      <p> After carrying out the research I had a much better understanding of the current process and the frustrations users face. Now, it was time to start thinking of how to solve the problems.      </p>

      <h4 class="bestpractice"> Sketching </h4>

      <p> My first idea was to fix the potential matches modal. Instead of just identifying a problem, it was important to provide a solution. Giving the users some kind of way to submit the candidate rather than just view the match. This change alone could significantly reduce the number of duplicates in the system.  </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/sketch2.png">

      <p> My second idea was to improve the search functionality. To do this, I suggested showing recommended candidates upon entering the page, rather than an empty state. These candidates would be based on how well their skills matched the job posting qualifications. If these candidates were good enough, the user may not even need to search at all! </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/sketch1.png">

      <h4 class="bestpractice"> Constraints </h4>


      <p> I presented these ideas to the larger team and although they were well perceived was too big of an effort from a development perspective. We would not be able to make changes to the search functionality or the potential matches modal. </p>

      <p>  Back to the drawing board...I had to find a way to increase the use of the search function without making changes to how the search and potential match modal work. I figured one way to do this would be to combine the two paths "Submit New" or "Submit Existing" to just one single flow.   </p>

      <!-- <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/sketch4.png"> -->
      <!-- <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/sketch3.png"> -->

      <h4 class="bestpractice"> Mockups </h4>

      <p> This idea was more feasible from a development perspective so I was encouraged to start building mockups based on the sketches. I created two high-fidelity mockups based on the sketches and presented them to the larger team.   </p>

      <!-- <p> Here you can see the condensed flow into one single "Submit Job Seeker" button </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/submit-js-base.png"> -->

      <br>

      <p> A few other touches to improve the UI: <br> • Progressive Disclosure - Reduced amount of information displayed upfront and reveal more when necessary <br> • Chunking Form Steps - Broke form into multiple steps to help improve scanning and comprehension.  <br> • Branded moment - Added image to more effectively communicate the search empty state.  </p>

      <h3> Presentation </h3>



      <p> After presenting the updated mockups to the senior leadership team, they liked the direction and and the project is set to be taken on for our next release cycle.  </p>
