      <h3 class="section-label"> Project Overview </h3>

      <h3> Background </h3>

      <p>  SAP Fieldglass is a software company that helps businesses find and manage external talent. </p>

      <p> Using SAP Fieldglass, companies post their open positions and staffing companies review and submit qualified workers.  </p>

      <h3> Problem </h3>

      <p>  Staffing companies were repeatedly creating multiple profiles for a single worker. </p>

      <h3> Goal </h3>

      <p>  Reduce the number of duplicate profiles created </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/process-diagram.png">

      <h3> User Flow </h3>

      <p> The flow for submitting a job seeker to a job posting. </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/flow-chart.png"/>

      <h3> Data Mining </h3>

      <p>  How many duplicate workers have been created in the database </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/dbm-data.png">

      <h3> Assumptions </h3>
      <p> Initially our team assumed that users did not understand the difference between the options to submit a new worker or an existing worker. </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/button-compare.png">

      <h3> User Interviews </h3>




      <p> To understand the difference why users did not take advantage of the submit existing feature, I reached out to people with experience submitting workers. </p>

      <p> The response I received proved our initial assumptions wrong </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/user-interview-quotes.png">

      <p>According to the interviews, the users actually do have a clear understanding of the actions. However, the search functionality is just too difficult to use. </p>

      <p> Also, we discovered that users only want to submit pre-existing workers 20% of the time. In most cases, they submit candidates that do not exist in the system. </p>

      <br> -->
      <h3> Journey Mapping </h3>

      <p> To illustrate my findings from the interviews I created a journey map to share with the larger team.</p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/customer-journey-submit-job-seeker-final.png">

      <h3> Opportunities </h3>

        <p> <b> Streamline the search process </b> - Improve efficiency and reduce friction. </p>
        <p> <b> Prioritize new worker </b> Account for the 80% scenario in new designs </p>

      <h3> Sketching & Ideation </h3>

        <p> Based on the data I started coming up with initial ideas. I kept the research in mind and focused on improving the search and prioritizing the new worker submission. </p>

      <h3> Mockups & Prototypes </h3>

      <p> After sharing the sketches with the larger team, it was decided idea of recommending workers was out of scope. </p>

      <p> However, I was encouraged to continue exploring the other ideas and create mockups for them. </p>

      <p> Additional Suggestions </p>

        <ul class="suggestions">
            <li> Chunking Form Steps </li>
            <li> Branded Moment </li>

      <h3> Feedback and Iteration </h3>

      <p> After sharing the mockups with the larger team during our design sessions, I received a lot of feedback which revisiting and rethinking certain aspects of the design. </p>

      <p> The team helped identify areas my designs were weak and strong and through incorporating their feedback, we were able to agree on this final design which is currently in development and set to be released in our next cycle. </p>

      <h3> Research </h3>


      <p> To begin the process, I needed a better understanding of how submitting a job seeker to a job posting works. To do this I created user scenarios and mapped out the flow. This helped me understand why a supplier arrives at the page and also the different steps that can be taken once they are there. </p>

      <!-- <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/scenarios.png"/> -->




      <!-- <h4 class="bestpractice"> Asking the Right Questions </h4>

      <p> With a clear understanding of the submission process, I still did not know why suppliers were not using the "Submit Existing" button. To me, the two options and their purpose seemed very clear, but I am not the user. So to try and put myself into their shoes, I started formulating a list of questions that would help provide insight and identify the underlying issue.   </p>

      <p> One strategy I find helpful when it comes to formulating good questions and putting together a story is the <a href="https://comm.gatech.edu/resources/writers/5ws" target="blank"> Five W's Method. </a> </p>

      <h4> Initial Questions: </h4>

      <ul class="project-two">
        <li> What is the total number of duplicate workforce records entered into the system? </li>
        <li> What percent of all job seeker submissions used "Submit Existing?" </li>
        <li> What percent of suppliers understand the difference between "Submit New" and "Submit Existing?" </li>
      </ul>

      <p> For a list of all my questions: <a href="../Images/submitx/one-pager.docx"> Download One Pager </a>


      <h4 class="bestpractice"> Data Driven Decision Making </h4>

      <!-- <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/search-keywords.png"> -->

      <!-- <p> To find answers to these questions, I reached out to the Data Mining Team (DBM). Here is what we found: </p>

      <h4> 1. "What percent of all job seeker submissions used "Submit Existing?" </h4> --> -->



      <!-- <ul class="data">
        <li> Total Submit Existing Submissions (2015-2019)</li>
          <ul class="data">
            <li> United States = 4,488,000 </li>
            <li> European Union = 184,253 </li>
          </ul>
        <li> Total Submit New Submissions (2015-2019) </li>
          <ul class="data">
            <li> United States = 15,717,968 </li>
            <li> European Union = 759,551 </li>
          </ul>
      </ul> -->

      <!-- <p> Using these numbers I could calculate the percentage of all submissions that used "Submit Existing." </p> -->

      <!-- <p class="percentages"> 22.01%  (US) &nbsp &nbsp 19.52%  (EU)  </p>

      <p>   </p>
      <p> </p>


      <h4> 2. "What is the total number of duplicate workforce records that are created?" </h4>

      <p class="percentages">  4,214,435 (US)  &nbsp &nbsp  201,545 (EU)    </p>

      <br>

      <h4> 1. "How many suppliers understand the difference between the meaning of "Submit New" and "Submit Existing" actions? </h4>

      <p> This question was not one that the DBM team could answer, so I reached out to the Professional Services (PS) team.  </p>

      <p class="psquote"> "Most suppliers are actually clear in their understanding of both actions, but it's faster to submit all candidates using 'Submit New' because the 'Submit Existing' search is too difficult." -Sreymoun (Professional Services) </p>

      <p> According to Sreymoun, most suppliers did understand the difference between the actions, but they just find searching for existing candidates (pictured below) too difficult. In many cases, she said it was just faster to submit all candidates as new candidates.  </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/search.png">

      <h4 class="bestpractice"> Customer Journey </h3>

      <p> The answers to the initial questions allowed me to better understand the pain points customers experience when submitting candidates to a job posting. To communicate the findings to the rest of the team I created a journey map. This helped everyone better understand the frustrations and align on what problem we needed to solve. On top of this, we could also identify areas of opportunity that would allow us to improve the experience even more. </p> -->

      <!-- <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/customer-journey-submit-job-seeker-final.png"> -->


<!--
      <h4 class="bestpractice"> Improving Search </h4>

      <p> After hearing from real suppliers that searching for existing workers was too difficult, I wanted to figure out how it could be improved. To do this I created more research questions focused on the search process itself. I used UserZoom to conduct user interviews hear what real suppliers had to say. I was eager to know...what is it about searching for candidates that makes it so difficult?  </p>

      <br>

      <h4> Finding 1 - Skills & qualifications </h4>

      <p> I wondered what they search when trying to find candidates and what information they want to see about those candidates.  </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/what-do-you-search.png">

      <p> Based on these results, it was clear that suppliers wanted to see not only see the name of the candidate, but also their skills. This made sense because skills and qualifications of a candidate are important when submitting them to a job posting. However, in the current search results table (below), the skills were not shown. </p>

      <p> An idea I had to improve this would be to automatically display the candidates in the database whose qualifications best match those detailed in the job posting. This could eliminate the need to search altogether and speed up the process even more. (This idea was out of scope as it was too big of a dev effort, but worth noting for future releases.)   </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/search.png">

      <br>
      <br>

      <h4> Finding 2 - Potential Matches </h4>

      <p> Another finding that helped us uncover an issue was the answer to our magic wand question. "If you could change any one thing regarding your entire process of submitting job seekers to job postings, what would it be? (i.e. if you had a magic wand, what's the one change/addition/removal you’d like to see supported by SAP Fieldglass?)"  </p>

      <p class="psquote"> "We frequently get a warning after entering a new candidate that a match already exists. However, there is no way to tell why that happens and there is no 'view matching candidates...' " </p>

      <p> This feedback points to the functionality that occurs when submitting a new candidate. If the system detects that the candidate may already exist, it gives a warning. </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/potentialmatch1.png">


      <br>
      <br>

      <p> However, this warning modal only identifies matches, but does not allow for further action. This lead me to think that the number of duplicate submissions could be greatly reduced if there was a way to submit the potential match instead. I wondered if this was just a bug and shared the information with my manager.  </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/potentialmatch2.png">


      <h3> Ideation </h3>

      <p> After carrying out the research I had a much better understanding of the current process and the frustrations users face. Now, it was time to start thinking of how to solve the problems.      </p>

      <h4 class="bestpractice"> Sketching </h4>

      <p> My first idea was to fix the potential matches modal. Instead of just identifying a problem, it was important to provide a solution. Giving the users some kind of way to submit the candidate rather than just view the match. This change alone could significantly reduce the number of duplicates in the system.  </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/sketch2.png">

      <p> My second idea was to improve the search functionality. To do this, I suggested showing recommended candidates upon entering the page, rather than an empty state. These candidates would be based on how well their skills matched the job posting qualifications. If these candidates were good enough, the user may not even need to search at all! </p>

      <img class="project-image" src="../Images/submitx/sketch1.png">

      <h4 class="bestpractice"> Constraints </h4>


      <p> I presented these ideas to the larger team and although they were well perceived was too big of an effort from a development perspective. We would not be able to make changes to the search functionality or the potential matches modal. </p>

      <p>  Back to the drawing board...I had to find a way to increase the use of the search function without making changes to how the search and potential match modal work. I figured one way to do this would be to combine the two paths "Submit New" or "Submit Existing" to just one single flow.   </p>

      <!-- <h4 class="bestpractice"> Mockups </h4>

      <p> These ideas were more feasible from a development perspective so I was encouraged to start building mockups based on the sketches. I created two high-fidelity mockups based on the sketches and presented them to the larger team.   </p> -->

      <!-- <br>

      <p> A few other touches to improve the UI: <br> • Progressive Disclosure - Reduced amount of information displayed upfront and reveal more when necessary <br> • Chunking Form Steps - Broke form into multiple steps to help improve scanning and comprehension.  <br> • Branded moment - Added image to more effectively communicate the search empty state.  </p>
