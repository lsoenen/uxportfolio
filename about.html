    <h3> About Me </h3>

    <p>
      I was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago and have a passion for technology and helping others. I believe that advancements and adoption of technology is one of the most effective ways to improve human lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      I graduated from the University of Michigan - School of Information with a concentration in UX Design. I am currently a UX Designer at SAP Fieldglass where I work to simplify challenging problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of work I enjoy anything that involves being active and getting outdoors. I also enjoy reading, video editing, and trying new things. New challenges and experiences help me get out of my comfort zone to learn and grow.
